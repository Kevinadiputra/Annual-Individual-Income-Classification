# Annual Individual Income Classification  

This repository contains the final project from the **Machine Learning Workshop** organized by **HIMASISKO**. The workshop was led by **Muhammad Irfan Karim, S.Kom.**, and spanned over 10 weeks of in-depth learning.  

## Workshop Overview  
During the workshop, participants were introduced to key concepts in machine learning, starting from foundational topics to advanced techniques, including:  
- **Data Fundamentals:** Understanding data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Extracting insights and visualizing patterns.  
- **Model Development:** Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.  
- **Deep Learning:** Introducing neural networks and advanced architectures.  

## About the Project  
The objective of this project is to classify annual individual income into predefined categories based on demographic and employment data. The project incorporates:  
- Data preprocessing techniques.  
- Exploratory data analysis for insights.  
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models.  
- Applying deep learning for improved accuracy.
